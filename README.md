<h1> Description </h1>
Blackjack game built using basic components of web i.e, HTML, CSS, JavaScript-(jQ)
User and Computer are introduced with 2 cards each and the motive of the game is to get a score higher than the computer but lower than 21. Computer's/ Dealers second card is faced backward so that user doesnt know the true score of computer.
 The object of the game is to "beat the dealer", which can be done in a number of
ways:
<ol>
  <li>
  Get 21 points on your first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;
  Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
  Let the dealer draw additional cards until his hand exceeds 21.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player is dealt an initial two-card hand and add together the value of their cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    The dealer (not the player) has to take hits until cards total 17 or more points.
  </li>
  <li>
    Values: Jack, Queen and King is 10, Ace is either 1 or 11, and all other cards have the value of their number.
  </li>
  <li>
    The order does not matter. For examples, get 13 points on “A + 2 + K “ and “K + 2 + A”
  </li>
</ol>
